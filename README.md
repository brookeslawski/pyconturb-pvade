# PyConTurb: Constrained Stochastic Turbulence for Wind Energy Applications

This Python package uses a novel method to generate stochastic turbulence boxes
that are constrained by one or more measured time series. A paper detailing
the simulation methodology will be submitted to Wind Energy.

## To install the code

Please note the code runs on Python 3.6.

Follow these instructions to install the package:
1. Clone the respository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the newly cloned folder in your terminal/Anaconda Prompt
3. `pip install -e . `


## Constrained or unconstrained turbulence

The main function, `gen_turb` can be used with or without constraining time
series.
 
## Examples

There is an example Jupyter notebook in the examples folder.

To run the notebook, do the following:
1. Open an Anaconda prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder with the notebook.
3. Enter `jupyter notebook` into the prompt.
4. When your internet browser opens up, click on the notebook. It should open
in a new tab.
