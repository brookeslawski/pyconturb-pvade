==============================

PyConTurb is a collaborative codebase to encourage knowledge-sharing and promote
the development of the wind energy field. Thus, although it was developed and
is maintained primarily by Jenni Rinker, many people have contributed
via issue reports, merge requests, etc. I enthusiastically thank the
following people, who have authored merge requests that have been integrated into
the code or documentation:
