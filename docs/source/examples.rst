===========================

Here are a few jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the code.

To run a notebook on your machine (requires jupyter and local cource code):
   1. In an Anaconda prompt, change to the directory with the notebooks  
   2. Enter ``jupyter notebook``  
   3. Your default internet browser should open and show your current directory  
   4. Click on the notebook you want to run and it will open in a new tab

The notebooks are located in ``docs/source/notebooks`` in the repository.
