Bugs and feature requests
==============================

This package is a labor of love, and it has by no means achieved perfection.
I have written many tests to ensure that the code is acting as expected, but
bugs may still be hiding! I am relying on you, the user, to report and/or
fix any bugs that you find in the code. Suggestions for improvement are also
welcome.

If you have a bug report or a feature request, **please do not email me 
directly**. Instead, use GitLab's
`issue tracker <https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/pyconturb/pyconturb/issues>`_.
Note that I am unfortunately unable to provide support for issues related to
incorrect usage.

You are welcome to email me if you would like to implement a feature in
PyConTurb. Otherwise, we can discuss in a merge request on GitLab.


Bugs
------------------------------

If you have found a bug in the code, where PyConTurb is not behaving as it
should, then please submit an issue using GitLab's
`issue tracker <https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/pyconturb/pyconturb/issues>`_.
**NOTE!** Please be sure to use the "Bug" template!


Feature requests
------------------------------

If you would like PyConTurb to have a specific feature that it currently
doesn't have, you have two options:

  1. Submit a Feature Request via GitLab's
     `issue tracker <https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/pyconturb/pyconturb/issues>`_.
     Be sure to use the "Feature request" template!
  2. Implement the feature in a new branch, and submit a merge request.
     (See instructions in the :ref:`Developer corner <developer_corner>`.)

Because PyConTurb is not under heavy development, priority will be given to
merge requests. A new feature request is only likely to be implemented if it is
needed in a separate project. Note that if you author a merge request and it is
accepted, you will be added to the list of contributors (unless you wish
otherwise).
